# BATbern Event Management Platform - UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for **BATbern Event Management Platform**'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Based on the comprehensive PRD v4 and Epic structure, this UI/UX specification addresses the unique challenge of designing for four distinct stakeholder groups using a React-based frontend architecture:
- **Event Organizers**: Need workflow efficiency, task management, and intelligent automation
- **Speakers**: Need simple submission and communication tools with self-service capabilities
- **Partners/Sponsors**: Need topic voting and strategic meeting coordination
- **Attendees**: Need content discovery, event information, and registration functionality

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Role-based interfaces with seamless role switching
- Progressive disclosure for complex 16-step event workflows
- Email & notification infrastructure with multi-channel delivery
- Content management with AWS S3/CloudFront integration
- User role management with promotion/demotion workflows
- Company management and Swiss UID integration

## 1. Overall UX Goals & Principles

### 1.1 Target User Personas

**Event Organizer (Primary Power User)**
- Technical professionals (Swiss IT community members) managing complex 16-step event workflows
- Need efficiency, task visibility, intelligent automation, and cross-role collaboration
- High frequency users requiring advanced features, keyboard shortcuts, and bulk operations
- Typical scenario: Managing 2-4 events annually with teams of 3-5 organizers

**Speaker/Presenter (Expert Contributors)**
- Busy IT professionals with limited time for submission processes
- Need clear expectations, simple workflows, self-service capabilities, and deadline visibility
- Occasional users (1-3 times per year) who must complete critical tasks accurately
- Typical scenario: Responding to invitation, submitting materials within tight deadlines

**Partner/Sponsor (Business Stakeholders)**
- Corporate decision-makers needing strategic input and meeting coordination
- Need topic voting interface, meeting scheduling, and future analytics capabilities
- Periodic users (quarterly voting, bi-annual meetings) focused on strategic influence
- Typical scenario: Voting on topics, attending partner meetings, reviewing strategic alignment

**Attendee/Community Member (End Consumers)**
- Swiss IT professionals seeking relevant content, networking, and learning
- Need content discovery, event information, registration, and historical archive access
- Varied usage patterns from first-time attendees to 10+ year veterans
- Typical scenario: Discovering upcoming events, registering, accessing past presentations

### 1.2 Usability Goals

- **Organizer Efficiency**: Reduce event planning time by 60% through intelligent workflow automation and task sequencing (16-step workflow ‚Üí automated checkpoints)
- **Speaker Simplicity**: New speakers complete invitation response and material submission in under 10 minutes with progressive saving and clear progress indicators
- **Partner Clarity**: Topic voting interface allows batch voting on 10+ topics in under 5 minutes with clear impact visualization
- **Content Discovery**: Attendees find relevant historical content within 30 seconds using semantic search across 20+ years of archives
- **Role Transition**: Users with multiple roles switch contexts in <2 clicks with preserved state and clear visual role indicators
- **Mobile Experience**: Critical speaker tasks (invitation response, material upload) and attendee actions (registration, content viewing) fully functional on mobile devices
- **Notification Clarity**: Multi-channel notification system delivers actionable alerts without overwhelming users (intelligent batching, priority-based delivery)
- **Company Management**: Organizers can create/edit company profiles with Swiss UID verification in under 3 minutes

### 1.3 Design Principles

1. **Role-Centric Design** - Each user sees only what's relevant to their current role and goals. Navigation, dashboards, and actions adapt to user permissions and context. Clear visual differentiation between role-specific portals.

2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Complex workflows (16-step event creation, material submission) broken into manageable steps with clear progress indicators. Advanced features hidden until needed, revealed through contextual triggers.

3. **Contextual Intelligence** - System provides smart defaults, recommendations, and automation based on user behavior, historical patterns, and role expertise. Predictive task suggestions reduce cognitive load.

4. **Immediate Value** - Every screen provides clear value proposition and next actions. No empty states without guidance. First-time users see contextual onboarding; returning users see personalized dashboards.

5. **Swiss Professional Precision** - Clean, reliable, professional aesthetic aligned with Swiss business culture. Minimal decorative elements; focus on clarity, data accuracy, and trust-building. Innovation in functionality, not visual experimentation.

6. **Notification-First Mindset** - Proactive communication keeps stakeholders aligned across complex multi-role workflows. Intelligent escalation prevents bottlenecks; cross-role visibility enables collaboration.

7. **Content-as-Asset** - Treat historical presentations and event materials as valuable, searchable, discoverable assets. Metadata-rich, properly categorized, with lifecycle management (S3 storage tiers, CDN delivery).

## 2. Information Architecture (IA)

**Mobile Layout** (4-column grid):
- All items scale proportionally
- Auto-row height (200px)
- Maintains aspect ratios
- 2√ó2 minimum for featured images

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Use for event photo showcases (past events, venue photos, community highlights)
- Minimum 6 photos for balanced asymmetric layout
- Maximum 12 photos per gallery (implement pagination for more)
- Images should be high quality (min 1200px width for desktop)
- Maintain 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratios for best results
- Add descriptive alt text for each photo
- Hover effects: Blue overlay (blue-400/10 opacity) + subtle scale
- Click to open lightbox/modal for full-size view

**Accessibility**:
- Each image has descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Main Event Space with attendees networking")
- Keyboard navigable with `tabIndex={0}` on each gallery item
- Focus indicators visible (ring-2 ring-blue-400)
- Semantic `role="list"` for gallery container
- Each image card has `role="listitem"`
- Icons decorative with `aria-hidden="true"`

**Interaction Patterns**:
- **Hover** (Desktop): Blue overlay fades in (300ms), icon color shifts zinc-600 ‚Üí zinc-500
- **Focus** (Keyboard): Focus ring appears with blue-400 accent
- **Click**: Opens lightbox modal with full-size image and navigation
- **Mobile**: Tap to view full-size, swipe for next/previous

**React Implementation Notes**:
- Built with Tailwind CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-4 md:grid-cols-12`)
- Responsive breakpoints: 4 cols (mobile) ‚Üí 12 cols (desktop)
- `auto-rows-[200px]` for consistent row height
- CSS Grid `col-span-*` and `row-span-*` for asymmetric layout
- Lazy loading with Intersection Observer API
- CDN images served via CloudFront
- WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Image optimization: max 1920px width, 80% quality
- Lightbox component: react-image-lightbox or photoswipe
- Placeholder gradient: `bg-gradient-to-br from-zinc-800 to-zinc-900`

**Performance Considerations**:
- Lazy load images below fold (only load first 3 initially)
- Use `loading="lazy"` attribute on img tags
- Implement blur-up placeholder technique (LQIP)
- Preload featured image (largest, top-left)
- Maximum 12 images per page (pagination for more)
- Total gallery bundle size: ~50KB (component + styles)

**Design File Reference**:
- [story-2.4-current-event-landing.md](../wireframes/story-2.4-current-event-landing.md) - Integrated into public landing page

## 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

### 9.1 Motion Principles

**Purposeful Animation**: Animation enhances usability, provides feedback, and guides attention. Never purely decorative.

**Motion Guidelines**:
- **Smooth transitions** between states (loading ‚Üí loaded, collapsed ‚Üí expanded)
- **Loading indicators** for async operations (spinner, skeleton screens, progress bars)
- **Subtle feedback** for user actions (button press, form submission, toggle switch)
- **Reduced motion support**: Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility

**Performance Targets**:
- Maintain 60fps for all animations
- Use CSS transforms (translate, scale, rotate) instead of position changes
- Avoid animating layout-triggering properties (width, height, margin)
- Use `will-change` sparingly for complex animations

### 9.2 Key Animations

**Page Transitions**:
- **Duration**: 300ms
- **Easing**: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) (Material Design standard ease)
- **Effect**: Fade + slide (20px vertical translation)
- **Usage**: Route changes, modal open/close

**Loading States**:
- **Skeleton Screens**:
  - Duration: 1.5s infinite pulse
  - Easing: ease-in-out
  - Effect: Gray placeholder with shimmer gradient sweep
  - Usage: Content loading (event cards, speaker lists)

- **Spinner**:
  - Duration: 1s infinite rotation
  - Easing: linear
  - Effect: Circular progress indicator (Material-UI CircularProgress)
  - Usage: Button loading states, form submissions

**Form Validation**:
- **Error Shake**:
  - Duration: 400ms
  - Easing: ease-in-out
  - Effect: Horizontal shake (¬±10px)
  - Usage: Invalid form submission, incorrect password

- **Success Checkmark**:
  - Duration: 600ms
  - Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55) (bounce)
  - Effect: Checkmark scale from 0 to 1 with slight overshoot
  - Usage: Form submission success, task completion

**Data Updates**:

  - Duration: 200ms
  - Effect: Elevation increase (1 ‚Üí 2), subtle scale(1.02)

- **Toggle Switch**:
  - Duration: 250ms
  - Effect: Smooth slide transition with color change

- **Toast Notifications**:
  - Duration: 300ms (enter), 200ms (exit)
  - Effect: Slide in from top-right with fade

**Micro-interactions**:

- **Dropdown Expand**: Accordion expand with content fade-in
- **Search Autocomplete**: Dropdown slides down with stagger effect for list items

## 10. Performance Considerations

### 10.1 Performance Goals

**Page Load Targets**:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 1.5 seconds on 3G networks
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5 seconds on 3G networks
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 (minimal layout shifts)

**Interaction Response Targets**:
- **UI Response Time**: < 100ms for all user interactions (button clicks, form inputs)
- **Search Results**: < 500ms for autocomplete suggestions
- **Form Validation**: < 50ms for client-side validation feedback
- **Route Changes**: < 300ms for navigation transitions

**Animation Performance**:
- **Target FPS**: 60fps for all animations and scrolling
- **Dropped Frames**: < 5% frame drops during complex animations
- **GPU Acceleration**: Use CSS transforms for hardware acceleration

### 10.2 Design Strategies for Performance

**Progressive Image Loading**:
- Low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) with blur-up effect
- Lazy loading for images below fold (Intersection Observer API)
- Responsive images with `srcset` for different device sizes
- WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallbacks

**Optimized Assets**:
- **Icon Fonts**: Material Icons web font with subset loading (only used icons)
- **SVG Optimization**: SVGO compression for custom icons and logos
- **Font Loading**: Font-display: swap for web fonts to prevent FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text)
- **Image Compression**: Optimized speaker photos and company logos (max 200KB per image)

**React-Specific Optimizations**:
- **Code Splitting**:
  - Route-based code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
  - Separate bundles for Organizer, Speaker, Partner, Attendee portals
  - Lazy load heavy components (charts, image editors, PDF viewers)

- **Component Optimization**:
  - React.memo for pure components (SpeakerCard, TopicCard, EventCard)
  - useMemo for expensive calculations (search filtering, data transformations)
  - useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
  - Virtual scrolling for long lists (react-window or react-virtualized)

- **State Management**:
  - Context API for global state (user, theme, notifications)
  - Local state for component-specific data (form inputs, UI toggles)
  - React Query for server state caching (reduces API calls)
  - Zustand for complex state with minimal re-renders

**Bundle Optimization**:
- **Tree Shaking**: ES module imports to eliminate dead code
- **Dynamic Imports**: Load role-specific code on demand
- **Vendor Splitting**: Separate vendor bundle for React, MUI, third-party libraries
- **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli compression for all static assets

**Content Delivery**:
- **CDN Usage**: CloudFront for static assets (images, presentations, logos)
- **Cache Strategy**:
  - Long cache TTL (7 days) for static assets with versioned filenames
  - Short cache TTL (5 minutes) for API responses
  - Service worker caching for PWA offline support

- **Prefetching**:
  - DNS prefetch for external domains
  - Preconnect to API and CDN origins
  - Prefetch next likely route (e.g., speaker detail from speaker list)

**Monitoring & Measurement**:
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM)**: Track actual user performance metrics
- **Lighthouse CI**: Automated performance audits in CI/CD pipeline
- **Web Vitals**: Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in production
- **Performance Budgets**: Fail builds if bundle size exceeds limits (main bundle < 200KB gzipped)
