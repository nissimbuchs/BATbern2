# BATbern Event Management Platform - UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for BATbern Event Management Platform's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Based on the comprehensive brainstorming session and enhanced PRD, this UI/UX specification addresses the unique challenge of designing for four distinct stakeholder groups using a React-based frontend architecture:

    E --> E3[Import from Previous Event]

    H --> H1[Search Speaker Database]
    H --> H2[Import External Speakers]
    H --> H3[Community Recommendations]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Date Conflicts**: System warns of conflicting events/holidays, suggests alternatives
- **Topic Duplication**: Alerts if similar topic used recently, shows previous events
- **Speaker Unavailability**: Automated fallback to alternative speaker suggestions
- **Venue Booking Issues**: Integration with venue calendar, automatic waitlist management
- **Team Member Unavailability**: Task reassignment with notification workflows

**Notes**: This flow automates the first 4 steps of the current 16-step manual process, setting foundation for remaining workflow automation.

### Flow 2: Speaker Invitation & Response (Speaker)

**User Goal**: Respond to speaking invitation and submit required materials efficiently

**Entry Points**:
- Email invitation link → Direct to response page
- Speaker portal → "My Invitations"
- BATbern website → Speaker login → Active invitations

**Success Criteria**: Clear response provided, materials submitted if accepted, organizer notified

    L -->|Related| O[Similar Content]
    L -->|Follow Up| P[Contact Speaker]

    J --> Q[Register for Similar Future Events]
    Q --> R[Event Registration Flow]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **No Results Found**: Alternative search suggestions, browse by category, contact support
- **Content Access Issues**: Login prompts, guest access limitations, technical troubleshooting
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design, download for offline, mobile-optimized viewing
- **Registration Full**: Waitlist management, alternative event suggestions, notification preferences

- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono (code examples, technical content)

#### Type Scale
| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| H1 | 2.5rem | 700 | 1.2 |
| H2 | 2rem | 600 | 1.3 |

**Spacing Scale**: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px (based on 8px system)

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target
**Standard**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for Swiss public sector compatibility

### Key Requirements
**Visual**:
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px solid outline with high contrast
- Text sizing: Scalable up to 200% without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction**:
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, live regions for dynamic content
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices

**Content**:
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all images, diagrams, and charts
- Heading structure: Logical hierarchy with no skipped levels
- Form labels: Clear, descriptive labels for all form inputs

### Testing Strategy
Automated accessibility testing with axe-core, manual keyboard navigation testing, screen reader validation with NVDA/JAWS, mobile accessibility testing with TalkBack/VoiceOver

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, small tablets |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | iPads, Android tablets |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, standard monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns
**Layout Changes**: Single column mobile, two-column tablet, multi-column desktop with collapsible sidebars
**Navigation Changes**: Hamburger menu mobile, full navigation desktop, role switcher adapts to available space
**Content Priority**: Critical actions always visible, progressive disclosure for secondary features
**Interaction Changes**: Touch-optimized mobile controls, hover states for desktop, gesture support for tablets

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
Purposeful animation that enhances usability: smooth transitions between states, loading indicators for async operations, subtle feedback for user actions, reduced motion support for accessibility preferences

### Key Animations
- **Page Transitions**: 300ms ease-out slide transitions (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1))
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens with pulse animation (Duration: 1.5s, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Form Validation**: Error shake animation for invalid inputs (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success Feedback**: Checkmark appearance with scale animation (Duration: 600ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55))
- **Data Updates**: Smooth chart transitions and number counting (Duration: 800ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load**: First meaningful paint under 2 seconds on 3G networks
- **Interaction Response**: UI response within 100ms for all user interactions
- **Animation FPS**: Maintain 60fps for all animations and transitions

### Design Strategies
Progressive image loading with low-quality placeholders, lazy loading for content below fold, optimized icon fonts and SVGs, efficient React rendering optimization with React.memo and useMemo, service worker implementation for offline capability

### React-Specific Performance Considerations
- **Component Optimization**: Use React.memo for pure components, useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback for event handlers
- **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense for role-specific portals
- **State Management**: Context API for global state, local state for component-specific data, consider Redux Toolkit for complex state scenarios
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets (event archives, speaker lists)
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking with ES modules, dynamic imports for role-specific functionality
