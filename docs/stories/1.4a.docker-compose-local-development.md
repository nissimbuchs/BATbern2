# Story 1.4a: Docker Compose Local Development Environment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a single-command local development environment with Docker Compose,
**so that** I can quickly start working without manual infrastructure setup and have consistent environments across the team.

## Domain Context

### Primary Domain
Shared Infrastructure & Core Services - Foundation for local development

### Involved Services
- API Gateway (existing)
- Shared Kernel (existing)
- Redis cache (local container)
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL (development environment)
- AWS Cognito (development environment)
- AWS S3, EventBridge (development environment)
- All future domain services

### Cross-Domain Dependencies
- This story enables all domain services to run locally
- Provides foundation for Stories 1.5-1.19 development
- Supports TDD workflow (Story 1.7) with real infrastructure
- Required for integration testing across all services

## Requirements Context

### Related Functional Requirements
- Infrastructure foundation for all functional requirements
- Supports local development and testing for FR1-FR24
- Enables EventBridge testing via LocalStack

### Workflow Steps (if applicable)
N/A - Infrastructure component supporting all workflows

### Acceptance Criteria Source
New story - ACs defined below for progressive docker-compose setup

## Architecture Context

### Architecture Patterns
**Referenced from architecture documentation:**
- **Container Orchestration** [Source: architecture/07-development-standards.md#local-development]: Docker Compose for local service orchestration
- **Service Discovery** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#integration-points]: Docker DNS for automatic service-to-service communication
- **Local AWS Simulation** [Source: architecture/02-infrastructure-deployment.md]: LocalStack for EventBridge, S3, Cognito testing
- **Development Workflow** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#git-workflow]: Consistent environment across all developers

### Infrastructure Components
**From 02-infrastructure-deployment.md and tech-stack.md:**
- **AWS RDS PostgreSQL 15**: Primary database (deployed to AWS DEV environment via CDK)
- **Redis 7.2**: Local caching layer in Docker (not deployed to AWS for dev)
- **AWS Cognito**: Real authentication service (deployed to AWS via CDK)
- **AWS S3, EventBridge**: Real AWS services for development testing
- **Docker Networking**: Service discovery for local containers
- **Auto-Generated .env**: Configuration fetched from AWS CDK stack outputs

## Wireframe Context

### Wireframe References
N/A - Infrastructure component with no direct UI

### UI Components
N/A - Backend infrastructure only

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AWS Infrastructure Connection**: Application containers connect to AWS DEV environment (RDS, Cognito)
2. **Local Redis Service**: Redis 7.2 runs locally in Docker (not deployed to AWS for dev)
3. **Auto-Generated Environment**: `setup-env.sh` script fetches config from AWS and generates `.env`
4. **API Gateway Integration**: API Gateway runs via docker-compose with AWS RDS and Cognito connection
5. **Service Discovery**: Local services can communicate using Docker DNS (service names as hostnames)
6. **Startup Orchestration**: Services start in correct order with health checks and dependencies
7. **Single Command Startup**: After running `setup-env.sh`, `docker-compose up` starts all local services successfully
8. **Hot Reload Support**: Code changes trigger automatic rebuilds in development mode
9. **AWS Credentials**: Script validates AWS credentials and fetches database secrets from Secrets Manager
10. **Documentation**: README.md updated with AWS prerequisites and docker-compose instructions
11. **Service Addition Template**: Clear documentation for adding new services to docker-compose.yml
12. **Developer Onboarding**: New developer can configure AWS access, run setup script, and start coding in <10 minutes

## Dev Notes - Implementation Guide

### Technical Design Notes

**Docker Compose Architecture:**
- Use modern Docker Compose (no version field needed)
- Implement service health checks for dependency management
- Use named volumes only for local services (Redis, Gradle cache)
- Configure custom networks for service isolation
- Enable BuildKit for faster builds
- Connect to AWS DEV environment for database and authentication

**AWS Integration Strategy:**
- **Database**: Connect to AWS RDS PostgreSQL in DEV environment
- **Authentication**: Use real AWS Cognito User Pool
- **Secrets**: Fetch database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
- **Configuration**: Auto-generate .env from CDK stack outputs
- **Redis**: Run locally in Docker (not deployed to AWS for dev)

**Service Startup Order:**
```yaml
# Dependency chain:
1. redis (local container, base dependency)
2. api-gateway (depends on redis, connects to AWS RDS and Cognito)
3. web-frontend (depends on api-gateway, uses Cognito for auth)
4. future domain services (depend on api-gateway, connect to AWS RDS)
```

**Health Check Strategy:**
```yaml
# Redis health check (local)
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
  interval: 5s
  timeout: 3s
  retries: 5

# API Gateway health check
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s
```

**AWS Connectivity Strategy:**
- Use AWS CLI to fetch configuration during setup
- Store credentials securely in .env (gitignored)
- Validate AWS credentials before starting services
- Fail fast with clear errors if AWS services unavailable

docker-compose up -d

# After code changes (hot reload enabled)
# Changes automatically detected and rebuilt

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api-gateway

# Restart single service
docker-compose restart api-gateway

# Regenerate .env after AWS infrastructure changes
AWS_PROFILE=batbern-mgmt ./scripts/dev/setup-env.sh

# Clean up local services (keeps AWS infrastructure)
docker-compose down -v
```

**Architecture Revision - AWS DEV Environment (October 2025)**:

After Story 1.4a initial implementation, a critical architecture review revealed that the platform uses AWS infrastructure for ALL environments, including development. The docker-compose configuration was revised to match the actual CDK deployment:

**Changes Made**:
1. **Deployed Cognito to AWS**: Deployed `BATbernCognitoStack` using `infrastructure/bin/infrastructure.ts`
   - User Pool ID: `eu-central-1_mJOsXM9jT`
   - Client ID: `495g9s2lvql4cs4b146ga1dgo7`
   - Domain: `https://batbern-auth.auth.eu-central-1.amazoncognito.com`

2. **Created Auto-Configuration Script**: `scripts/dev/setup-env.sh`
   - Fetches database endpoint from CDK stack outputs
   - Retrieves database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
   - Fetches Cognito configuration from CDK outputs
   - Auto-generates `.env` file (no manual .env.example needed)

3. **Removed Local Infrastructure**:
   - Removed `postgres` service (uses AWS RDS: `batbern-development-datab-rdsclusterinstancef6c625-ndybrlnbphdc.cl8iwau2qyle.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com`)
   - Removed `localstack` service (uses real AWS services)
   - Kept `redis` service (not deployed to AWS for dev environment per `database-stack.ts:51`)

4. **Updated docker-compose.yml**:
   - Removed PostgreSQL container
   - Removed LocalStack container
   - Kept Redis container (local only)
   - Updated api-gateway to connect to AWS RDS and Cognito
   - Updated web-frontend with Cognito configuration

5. **Cleaned Up Obsolete Files**:
   - Removed `scripts/db/init.sql` (not needed for AWS RDS)
   - Removed `scripts/localstack/init-aws.sh` (not using LocalStack)
   - Removed `.env.example` (replaced by auto-generation)

6. **Updated Documentation**:
   - README.md now explains AWS prerequisites and setup-env.sh usage
   - Story 1.4a reflects AWS-based architecture
   - Docker compose templates updated for AWS connection pattern

**Progressive Enhancement Ready**:
- Template documentation created for adding future services (Stories 1.14-1.19)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: Good**

The docker-compose infrastructure implementation demonstrates solid engineering with proper AWS integration, health checks, and dependency management. The setup-env.sh script provides excellent automation for AWS configuration retrieval. Documentation is comprehensive and helpful for developer onboarding.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean docker-compose.yml structure with proper service dependencies
- ✅ Robust AWS integration (RDS, Cognito, Secrets Manager)
- ✅ Comprehensive setup automation with good error handling
- ✅ Health checks properly configured for all services
- ✅ Security: .env files properly gitignored
- ✅ README.md comprehensive and accurate
- ✅ Developer onboarding workflow well-documented

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- ❌ **Zero automated tests exist** despite story specifying 27+ test cases across 6 acceptance criteria
- ❌ Story Task 4 marked complete but no test files found in infrastructure/test/docker-compose/ or scripts/test/
- ❌ Violates TDD standards (coding-standards.md:92-98)
- ❌ Violates minimum coverage requirements (coding-standards.md:159-163)

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: docs/DOCKER-COMPOSE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md
  - **Change**: Removed references to obsolete `postgres` and `localstack` containers
  - **Why**: Story v2.0 removed these services (using AWS RDS and real AWS services instead)
  - **How**: Updated sections 9 and 10 to reference AWS RDS instead of local postgres
  - **Lines**: 261-282, 292-309, 392-407, 418

- **File**: docs/DOCKER-COMPOSE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md
  - **Change**: Updated interactive shell access commands
  - **Why**: Removed references to removed services, added AWS RDS access instructions
  - **How**: Replaced postgres/localstack commands with AWS RDS connection instructions
  - **Lines**: 392-407

- **File**: docs/DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE-TEMPLATE.md
  - **Change**: Updated troubleshooting section for database connectivity
  - **Why**: Service template referenced non-existent `postgres` service
  - **How**: Changed to AWS RDS troubleshooting steps
  - **Lines**: 223-227

- **File**: scripts/dev/setup-env.sh
  - **Change**: Made script executable with chmod +x
  - **Why**: Ensures script can be run directly without explicit bash invocation
  - **How**: Applied executable permissions

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ❌ **FAIL** - TDD workflow violated (coding-standards.md:88-176)
  - Story specifies extensive test specifications (lines 86-152) but zero tests implemented
  - Test-first commit requirements not followed
  - Coverage requirements (85% minimum) cannot be met with 0% coverage

- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS
  - docker-compose.yml properly structured
  - Documentation in correct locations
  - .env handling secure and correct

- **Testing Strategy**: ❌ **FAIL** - No testing-strategy.md found, but TDD standards violated
  - Infrastructure tests required but not implemented
  - Integration tests for AWS connectivity missing
  - Shell script tests for setup-env.sh missing

- **All ACs Met**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL**
  - AC1-9, 11-12: ✅ Implementation complete (manual testing verified in Dev Agent Record)
  - AC10: ⚠️ Documentation exists but had accuracy issues (fixed during review)
  - **Critical**: No automated tests to validate any AC

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed During Review:**
- [x] Fixed DOCKER-COMPOSE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md obsolete postgres references (lines 261-282)
- [x] Fixed DOCKER-COMPOSE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md obsolete localstack references (line 400)
- [x] Updated service communication testing to reflect AWS architecture (lines 292-309)
- [x] Fixed DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE-TEMPLATE.md database troubleshooting (lines 223-227)
- [x] Made setup-env.sh executable

**Critical - Must Address Before Production:**
- [ ] **Write automated tests** for all 12 acceptance criteria as specified in story
  - [ ] infrastructure/test/docker-compose/docker-compose.test.ts (AC6,7)
  - [ ] infrastructure/test/docker-compose/service-discovery.test.ts (AC5)
  - [ ] infrastructure/test/docker-compose/aws-integration.test.ts (AC1,4,9)
  - [ ] scripts/test/test-docker-compose-startup.sh (AC6,7)
  - [ ] scripts/test/test-service-health.sh (AC2,6)
  - [ ] scripts/test/test-setup-env.sh (AC3,9)
  - [ ] scripts/test/test-aws-connectivity.sh (AC1,9)

**Medium Priority - Should Address:**
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed JSON in setup-env.sh jq parsing (line 94)
- [ ] Remove redundant DATABASE_URL from docker-compose.yml (can construct from components)
- [ ] Add validation that AWS_PROFILE exists in setup-env.sh (line 14)

**Low Priority - Nice to Have:**
- [ ] Add health check endpoint verification to setup-env.sh
- [ ] Consider adding docker-compose.override.yml pattern for local customization
- [ ] Add Dockerfile.dev optimization with BuildKit cache mounts

### Security Review

**Positive Findings:**
- ✅ .env files properly gitignored (lines 91-94)
- ✅ AWS credentials never stored in code
- ✅ Database passwords retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ setup-env.sh validates AWS credentials before proceeding
- ✅ Script provides clear warnings about sensitive data

**Areas of Concern:**
- ⚠️ .env file contains plaintext database password (line 147)
  - **Mitigation**: File is gitignored and only local
  - **Risk**: Low (development environment only)
  - **Recommendation**: Document in onboarding that .env should not be shared

- ⚠️ No encryption at rest for .env file
  - **Mitigation**: Standard practice for docker-compose local dev
  - **Risk**: Low (developer machines assumed secure)
  - **Recommendation**: Document secure workstation requirements

### Performance Considerations

**Positive:**
- ✅ Health check intervals appropriate (5s for Redis, 30s for API Gateway)
- ✅ Dockerfile.dev uses layer caching for dependencies
- ✅ Gradle cache volume prevents repeated dependency downloads
- ✅ Hot reload configured for fast development iteration

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider BuildKit cache mounts for even faster rebuilds
- Could add redis-commander for easier Redis debugging (optional)
- Health check start_period (60s) is conservative but safe

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified:**
- docs/DOCKER-COMPOSE-TROUBLESHOOTING.md (removed obsolete service references)
- docs/DOCKER-COMPOSE-SERVICE-TEMPLATE.md (fixed database troubleshooting)
- scripts/dev/setup-env.sh (made executable)

**Developer Action Required:**
- Please update File List in story with these refactored files

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Security: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- Implementation: ✅ Good (proper secrets handling, AWS authentication)
- Testing: ❌ None - no security validation tests exist
- Recommendation: Add tests for credential validation, failed auth scenarios

**Performance: ✅ PASS**
- Startup time reasonable (<2 minutes based on health check config)
- Resource usage appropriate for local development
- Hot reload enables fast iteration

**Reliability: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- Implementation: ✅ Good (health checks, dependency ordering, error handling)
- Testing: ❌ None - no reliability tests exist (restart, recovery, etc.)
- Recommendation: Add tests for service failures, restart scenarios

**Maintainability: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- Implementation: ✅ Good (clear structure, good documentation, templates)
- Testing: ❌ None - no automated validation of setup process
- Documentation: ✅ Comprehensive (now corrected)

### Requirements Traceability

**Total Test Gap: 27+ test cases specified but 0 implemented**

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4a-docker-compose-local-development.yml

**Summary:** Implementation is solid and functional, but completely lacks automated tests required by TDD standards and story specifications. Manual testing was performed (verified in Dev Agent Record) but automated test infrastructure is missing.

**Risk Profile:** Medium-High
- Implementation risk: Low (code quality good, manual testing done)
- Technical debt risk: High (no automated validation of critical infrastructure)
- Future maintenance risk: Medium (changes cannot be validated without tests)

**Recommendations:**
1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Add automated tests before marking story Done
2. **Option B (Pragmatic)**: Waive with explicit technical debt ticket and timeline for test implementation
3. **Option C (Not Recommended)**: Accept as-is and risk regression in future infrastructure changes

### Recommended Status

**❌ Changes Required** - Critical test gap must be addressed

**Rationale:**
- Implementation quality is good and functional
- Manual testing confirms functionality
- However, TDD standards require automated tests (coding-standards.md:92-98)
- Story explicitly specifies 27+ test cases that should exist
- Infrastructure changes without automated tests create significant technical debt
- AWS integration (security-sensitive) requires automated validation

**Recommendation:** Add automated tests as specified in story before marking Done, OR create explicit waiver with technical debt ticket for future test implementation.

**(Story owner decides final status and waiver decision)**
