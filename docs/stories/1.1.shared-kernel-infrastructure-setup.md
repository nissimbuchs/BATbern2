# Story 1.1: Shared Kernel Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** platform architect,
**I want** to establish the shared kernel foundation with common types and domain events,
**so that** all microservices can communicate consistently through domain-driven design patterns.

## Domain Context

### Primary Domain
Shared Infrastructure & Core Services - Foundation for all bounded contexts

### Involved Services
- Shared Kernel (new repository)
- API Gateway (future integration)
- All Domain Services (as consumers of shared types)
- EventBridge (for domain event publishing)

### Cross-Domain Dependencies
- This story enables all other domain services
- Required by Event Management, Speaker Coordination, Partner Analytics, and Attendee Experience services
- Provides foundation for cross-domain integration via EventBridge

## Requirements Context

### Related Functional Requirements
- FR1: Role-based authentication (shared user types)
- Support for all workflow automation requiring cross-service communication
- Foundation for all domain event publishing and consumption

### Workflow Steps (if applicable)
N/A - This is infrastructure foundation

### Acceptance Criteria Source

## Dev Notes - Implementation Guide

### Technical Design Notes

**Core Design Patterns:**
- **Value Object Pattern**: Immutable value objects for domain identifiers with built-in validation
- **Domain Event Pattern**: Events that represent something that happened in the domain
- **Publisher-Subscriber**: EventBridge integration for decoupled cross-service communication
- **Shared Kernel DDD**: Common language and concepts shared across all bounded contexts

**Package Structure (following source-tree.md):**
```
shared-kernel/
├── src/main/java/ch/batbern/shared/
│   ├── types/           # Domain value objects (EventId, SpeakerId, etc.)
│   ├── events/          # Domain events (DomainEvent, EventCreatedEvent, etc.)
│   ├── exceptions/      # Common exceptions (DomainException, ValidationException)
│   ├── utils/           # Utility classes (ValidationUtils, DateTimeUtils)
│   └── config/          # Spring configuration for EventBridge
├── src/test/java/       # Comprehensive test suite
└── build.gradle         # Dependencies and publishing configuration
```

**Service Method Signatures:**
```java
// EventBridge Publisher
public interface DomainEventPublisher {
    void publish(DomainEvent event);
    CompletableFuture<Void> publishAsync(DomainEvent event);
    void publishBatch(List<DomainEvent> events);
}

// Validation Utilities
public class ValidationUtils {
    public static void validateSwissUID(String uid) throws ValidationException;
    public static void validateEmail(String email) throws ValidationException;
    public static void validateRequired(Object value, String fieldName);
}
```

### API Contracts

**Domain Event Schema (EventBridge Format):**
```json
{
  "version": "0",
  "id": "uuid",
  "detail-type": "EventCreatedEvent",
  "source": "batbern.event-management",
  "account": "aws-account-id",
  "time": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
  "region": "eu-central-1",
  "detail": {
    "eventId": "uuid",
    "eventType": "CONFERENCE",
    "title": "BATbern 2024",
    "organizerId": "uuid",
    "createdAt": "2024-12-20T10:00:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "version": "1.0",
      "source": "event-management-service"
    }
  }
}
```

**Value Object Examples:**
```java
@Value
@Builder
public class EventId {
    @NonNull
    private final UUID id;

    public static EventId generate() {
        return new EventId(UUID.randomUUID());
    }

    public static EventId from(String idString) {
        try {
            return new EventId(UUID.fromString(idString));
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            throw new ValidationException("Invalid EventId format: " + idString);
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

**Coverage Targets:**
- Unit Tests: 90% for all value objects and utilities
- Integration Tests: 100% for EventBridge publishing
- Overall: 90% line coverage minimum

**Testing Approach:**
- **TDD Mandatory**: Write tests first for all functionality
- **Test Data Builders**: Create builders for complex test objects
- **Contract Testing**: Verify EventBridge event schemas
- **Performance Testing**: Validate event publishing performance under load

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Value object validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Domain event serialization/deserialization roundtrip
- EventBridge publishing success and failure scenarios
- Concurrent event publishing performance
- Backward compatibility of serialized events

**Mock Configurations:**
```java
@TestConfiguration
public class SharedKernelTestConfig {
    @Bean
    @Primary
    public EventBridgeAsyncClient mockEventBridgeClient() {
        return Mockito.mock(EventBridgeAsyncClient.class);
    }
}
```
