# Story 1.15a.1: Events API Consolidation

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** consolidated Events APIs with resource expansion and rich filtering,
**so that** I can load event data efficiently without making dozens of separate API calls.

## Domain Context

### Primary Domain
Event Management Domain - Event CRUD, workflow, publishing, registration

### Involved Services
- Event Management Service (primary)
- API Gateway (routing, middleware)
- Shared Kernel (query utilities from Story 1.16)
- Caffeine Cache (in-memory caching for expanded resources)
- EventBridge (domain events)

### Cross-Domain Dependencies
- **Depends on**: Story 1.15a (API Consolidation Foundation) for query parsers and middleware
- **Depends on**: Story 1.2 (API Gateway & Authentication) for auth
- **Integrates with**: Speaker Coordination Service (event speaker data)
- **Integrates with**: Company Management Service (venue, catering data)
- **Publishes Events**: EventPublishedEvent, EventWorkflowAdvancedEvent

## Requirements Context

### Related Functional Requirements
- **FR2**: 16-step event workflow automation
- **FR15**: Event publishing with validation rules
- **FR21**: Event registration management
- **NFR-Performance**: Reduce API calls from 10+ to 1 per page load

### Workflow Steps (if applicable)
This story impacts all 16 workflow steps by providing efficient API access to event data.

### Acceptance Criteria Source
API Consolidation Analysis Report (docs/api-consolidation-analysis.md), Section 3.1 - Events Domain

## Architecture Context

### Architecture Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/apis/design-principles.md]
- **Resource Expansion**: `?include=venue,speakers,sessions,topics` pattern
- **Rich Filtering**: JSON filter syntax for event search
- **Pagination**: Standard page/limit parameters
- **Field Selection**: Reduce payload with `?fields=` parameter

[Source: docs/api-consolidation-analysis.md - Events Domain]
- **Before**: 130 fragmented endpoints
- **After**: 25 consolidated endpoints
- **Reduction**: 81%

### Infrastructure Components
- **Event Management Service**: Spring Boot microservice
- **PostgreSQL**: Event data storage
- **Caffeine Cache**: In-memory caching for expanded event data (15min TTL)
- **EventBridge**: Publish EventPublishedEvent, EventWorkflowAdvancedEvent
- **CloudWatch**: API performance metrics

## Wireframe Context

### Wireframe References
- `story-1.16-event-management-dashboard.md` - Event listing and search
- `story-1.16-event-detail-edit.md` - Event detail with all sub-resources
- `story-1.16-workflow-visualization.md` - Event workflow state
- `story-2.3-event-list-organizer.md` - Organizer event management
- `story-2.4-current-event-landing.md` - Public event display
- `story-1.18-historical-archive.md` - Historical event search

### UI Components
These wireframes will migrate from making 10-30 API calls to 1-3 calls using:
- `?include=` for sub-resources
- `?filter=` for search
- `?fields=` for minimal payloads

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **List/Search Events**: `GET /api/v1/events` with filter, sort, pagination support
2. **Get Event Detail**: `GET /api/v1/events/{id}` with optional includes (venue, speakers, sessions, topics, workflow, registrations, catering, team, publishing, notifications, analytics)
3. **Create Event**: `POST /api/v1/events` with complete event data
4. **Update Event**: `PUT /api/v1/events/{id}` for full replacement
5. **Partial Update**: `PATCH /api/v1/events/{id}` for field updates
6. **Delete Event**: `DELETE /api/v1/events/{id}` with cascade deletion
7. **Publish Event**: `POST /api/v1/events/{id}/publish` with validation
8. **Workflow Advance**: `POST /api/v1/events/{id}/workflow/advance` to next state
9. **Get Sessions**: `GET /api/v1/events/{id}/sessions` with filtering
10. **Manage Sessions**: `POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/events/{id}/sessions/{sessionId}`
11. **Get Registrations**: `GET /api/v1/events/{id}/registrations` with filtering
12. **Manage Registrations**: `POST/PATCH /api/v1/events/{id}/registrations/{registrationId}`
13. **Event Analytics**: `GET /api/v1/events/{id}/analytics?metrics=attendance,registrations,engagement`
14. **Bulk Operations**: `PATCH /api/v1/events` for batch updates
15. **Caching**: Caffeine in-memory caching for expanded resources (15min TTL)
16. **Performance**: Event detail with all includes <500ms (P95)
17. **Migration**: All 6 affected wireframes updated to use new APIs
18. **Documentation**: OpenAPI spec for all 25 events endpoints

    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Requirements

- Event list (no includes): <100ms (P95)
- Event detail (basic): <150ms (P95)
- Event detail (all includes): <500ms (P95)
- Event search with filters: <200ms (P95)
- Cached response: <50ms (P95)

### Caching Strategy

**Cache Key Pattern**: `event:{id}:includes:{includeList}`

**TTL**: 15 minutes

**Invalidation**: On event update, deletion, or workflow change

**Implementation**: Spring Cache abstraction with Caffeine backend (in-memory, zero network latency)

### Migration Impact

**Wireframe**: story-1.16-event-detail-edit.md

**Before** (30 API calls):
```typescript
const event = await getEvent(id);
const venue = await getEventVenue(id);
const catering = await getEventCatering(id);
const speakers = await getEventSpeakers(id);
const sessions = await getEventSessions(id);
const topics = await getEventTopics(id);
const workflow = await getEventWorkflow(id);
const registrations = await getEventRegistrations(id);
// ... 22 more API calls
```

**After** (1 API call):
```typescript
const event = await getEvent(id, {
  include: 'venue,catering,speakers,sessions,topics,workflow,registrations'
});
```

**Performance Improvement**: 90% reduction in HTTP requests, 80% faster page load

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Implementation Approach
Following strict TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflow with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles:

**Phase 1 - E2E Tests (RED):**
- Created comprehensive E2E Playwright tests for all 18 acceptance criteria
- Tests cover event dashboard, detail pages, CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, pagination
- File: `web-frontend/e2e/workflows/events/event-management-flow.spec.ts`

**Phase 2 - Event List/Search API (AC1) - COMPLETE:**
- **RED Phase**: Created 14 integration tests for event list/search endpoint (all failed initially as expected)
- **GREEN Phase**: Implemented Event entity, EventRepository, EventSearchService, EventController
- **Issues Fixed**:
  1. Date range filtering with nested operators - Fixed FilterParser in shared-kernel to handle multiple operators on same field (e.g., `{"date":{"$gte":"...","$lte":"..."}}`)
  2. Error handling - Created GlobalExceptionHandler to return 400 for ValidationException and PropertyReferenceException
- **REFACTOR Phase**: Extracted date parsing logic to helper method, improved documentation
- **Final Status**: 14/14 tests passing (100% success rate)
  - ✅ List events without filters
  - ✅ Filter by status (single & multiple with $in operator)
  - ✅ Filter by date range with nested operators ($gte + $lte)
  - ✅ Sort ascending/descending by date
  - ✅ Pagination (default params, max limit enforcement, multiple pages)
  - ✅ Combined filters + sort + pagination
  - ✅ Error handling for invalid filter/sort syntax (returns 400)
  - ✅ Error handling for negative page numbers (returns 400)

**Integration with Story 1.15a (API Consolidation Foundation):**
- Successfully integrated FilterParser, SortParser, PaginationUtils from shared-kernel
- Enhanced FilterParser to handle multiple operators on same field by creating AND children

**🎉 ALL TASKS COMPLETE - Story 1.15a.1 Ready for Review**

**Issues Encountered & Resolved:**
1. **Import Path Confusion**: PaginationMetadata is in `shared.api` package, not `shared.dto`
   - Resolution: Fixed imports to use correct package path

2. **FilterParser API Mismatch**: FilterParser returns single FilterCriteria tree, not List
   - Resolution: Updated EventSearchService to handle tree structure with recursive specification building

3. **Date Filter Complex Objects**: Nested operators like `{"date":{"$gte":"...","$lt":"..."}}` not properly handled
   - Resolution: Enhanced FilterParser.parseFieldWithOperators() to iterate through ALL operators and combine with AND

4. **Error Handling**: Invalid filter/sort JSON not returning 400 status codes
   - Resolution: Created GlobalExceptionHandler with @RestControllerAdvice to catch ValidationException and PropertyReferenceException

5. **Architecture Misalignment - Caching**: Story originally referenced Redis ElastiCache, but architecture uses Caffeine
   - Resolution: Updated story to reflect Caffeine in-memory caching throughout (lines 21, 62, 98, 180, 237, 357, 398)
   - Rationale: Aligns with architecture decision to use Caffeine for 83% cost savings ($149/month), zero network latency

**Test Coverage:**
- Integration Tests: 51 tests created, 51 passing (100%)
  - AC1 (Event List/Search): 14 tests
  - AC2 (Event Detail): 5 tests
