# Sprint Change Proposal: Notification & Email System Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Trigger:** Discovery of missing notification and email management requirements during PRD review
**Interaction Mode:** YOLO (Batch Processing)
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED & IMPLEMENTED

---

## Executive Summary

### Change Trigger
During PRD review via [docs/todo.md](docs/todo.md), four critical notification and email-related requirements were discovered missing implementation specifications:
1. Email template management system (FR20 enhancement)
2. User notification preference system (FR14 enhancement)
3. Notification escalation rules (FR20 enhancement)
4. AWS SES integration specifications (Infrastructure requirement)

### Recommended Path
**Option 1 - Direct Adjustment / Integration** (APPROVED)
- Add notification infrastructure through story additions and enhancements across Epics 2-5
- +3-5 weeks distributed timeline impact
- No MVP scope change - only adding implementation detail to existing requirements

### Impact Summary
- **PRD**: 4 functional requirement enhancements + 3 new infrastructure requirements
- **Architecture**: 3 documents updated (API, Data, Infrastructure)
- **Epics**: 4 epic documents enhanced with notification specifications
- **Timeline**: +2 weeks (Epic 3), +0.5 weeks (Epic 2, Epic 4), +0 weeks (Epic 5) = **3 weeks total**
- **MVP Scope**: UNCHANGED - specifications for already-scoped features

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: AWS SES Production Access Delay
- **Mitigation**: Start SES request IMMEDIATELY (Week 1), use SES Sandbox for development, prepare SendGrid fallback

### Risk 2: Email Deliverability Issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement DKIM/SPF/DMARC from day 1, warm-up period (gradual volume increase), double opt-in for newsletters

### Risk 3: Notification Overload (User Fatigue)
- **Mitigation**: Default to digest mode, smart frequency capping (max 1 email/day), granular opt-out controls
