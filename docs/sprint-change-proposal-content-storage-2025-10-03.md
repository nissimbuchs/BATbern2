# Sprint Change Proposal: Content Management & Storage Architecture

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Triggering Story:** Story 1.11 - Security & Compliance Essentials
**Prepared By:** John (Product Manager Agent)
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All edits implemented
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-03

---

## Executive Summary

During implementation of Story 1.11 (Security & Compliance Essentials), we discovered that **Content Management & Storage Architecture** is referenced throughout the project (41 files) but never properly specified. This gap blocks Epic 3 Story 3.3 (Speaker Material Submission) and affects 5 stories across 3 epics.

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive S3/CloudFront architecture documentation NOW (Option 1: Direct Adjustment) as part of Story 1.11 expansion.

**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED** - Proceed with all proposed edits

---

## 1. Identified Issue Summary

**Issue Type:** Newly discovered requirement (missing architectural specification)

**Core Problem:**
- **Data Architecture** references `CompanyLogo.s3Key` and `SessionMaterials` with no implementation guidance
- **Infrastructure Document** has 680 lines on SES email but ZERO lines on S3/CloudFront storage
- **Epic 1, 3, 5** stories reference "S3 integration", "large file uploads", "CDN delivery" without architecture
- **Story 1.11 GDPR export** missing user-uploaded content (presentations, photos, CVs, logos)

**Evidence:**
- 41 files reference S3/CloudFront/storage across docs
- Epic 1 Story 1.14: "Secure logo upload to S3 with CDN integration" (line 888)
- Epic 3 Story 3.3: "Large file uploads work reliably" (line 122), "S3 integration secure with presigned URLs" (line 124)
- Current implementation has incomplete GDPR compliance (no file export/deletion)

---

## 2. Epic Impact Summary

| Epic | Stories Affected | Impact Level | Timeline |
|------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| **Epic 1 (Foundation)** | 1.11, 1.14, 1.15 | High | Weeks 1-12 (CURRENT) |
| **Epic 3 (Speaker Mgmt)** | 3.3 | **CRITICAL BLOCKER** | Weeks 21-30 |
| **Epic 5 (Attendee Exp)** | 5.1 | Medium (degraded performance) | Weeks 39-46 |

**Total Impact:** 5 stories across 3 epics

---

## 3. Artifact Adjustment Needs

| Document | Current State | Required Changes | Lines Added |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| **prd-enhanced.md** | Mentions S3 in tech stack | Add Section 4.2: Content Management & Storage Architecture | ~150 |
| **02-infrastructure-deployment.md** | 0 lines on S3 | Add S3 + CloudFront infrastructure with CDK code | ~400 |
| **03-data-architecture.md** | References s3Key with no details | Add ContentMetadata, SessionMaterials, StorageQuota interfaces | ~100 |
| **04-api-design.md** | No file upload endpoints | Add presigned URL, upload/download API specs | ~80 |
| **Story 1.11** | GDPR missing files | Expand GDPR export/deletion + file upload security | ~10 |

**Total Documentation:** ~740 lines added

---

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

**Selected: Option 1 - Direct Adjustment / Integration** ✅

**Rationale:**
1. **Minimal Disruption**: Purely additive documentation, no code rollback
2. **Proactive Planning**: Unblocks Epic 3 Story 3.3 (10 weeks away)
3. **Cost Effective**: 8-10 hours vs 14-17 (rollback) or 12+ (defer with debt)
4. **Quality**: Story 1.11 GDPR export will be complete
5. **No Technical Debt**: Address gap immediately

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Documentation Updates (6-8 hours)**
1. Add PRD Section 4.2 with S3 strategy, CloudFront CDN, file constraints, quotas, backup/DR
2. Add 02-infrastructure-deployment.md S3 + CloudFront sections with CDK TypeScript code
3. Update 03-data-architecture.md with ContentMetadata, StorageQuota interfaces
4. Add file upload/download API endpoints to 04-api-design.md

**Phase 2: Story Updates (2 hours)**
5. Extend Story 1.11 acceptance criteria for S3 content in GDPR export + file upload security
6. Add implementation notes to Story 1.14 (Company Management)
7. Add content migration S3 strategy to Story 1.15 (Historical Data Migration)

**Phase 3: Review & Approval (1-2 hours)**
8. Stakeholder review of new architecture sections
9. Team alignment on storage patterns
10. Final approval to proceed

**Total Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Timeline Impact:** Story 1.11 extended by ~2 hours, Epic 1 completion unaffected

---

## 5. PRD MVP Impact

**No MVP scope changes required.**

This is an architectural specification gap, not a new feature. All affected stories already reference S3/CloudFront but lacked implementation details. Adding the architecture documentation enables existing planned stories to be implemented correctly.

## 8. Specific Proposed Edits

### Edit 1: PRD Section 4.2
**File:** `docs/prd-enhanced.md`
**Location:** After line 160
**Action:** INSERT new section

**Content to Add:**
```markdown
### 4.2 Content Management & Storage Architecture

The BATbern platform manages diverse content types including company logos, speaker photos and CVs, event presentations, and historical archives. This section defines the storage architecture, CDN strategy, and content policies.

#### AWS S3 Storage Strategy

**Bucket Architecture:**
- **Environment Separation**: Separate S3 buckets per environment (development, staging, production)
- **Bucket Naming**: `batbern-{environment}-{content-type}` (e.g., `batbern-prod-presentations`, `batbern-prod-logos`)
- **Content Types**:
  - `presentations`: Speaker presentation files (PDF, PPTX)
  - `logos`: Company and partner logos (PNG, JPG, SVG)
  - `profiles`: Speaker photos and CVs (JPG, PNG, PDF)
  - `archives`: Historical event materials and photo galleries

**S3 Key Structure:**
```
/{content-type}/{year}/{entity-id}/{filename-with-uuid}
Examples:
  /presentations/2024/evt-123/speaker-456-presentation-a7b3c9d2.pdf
  /logos/2024/company-789/logo-f3e8d1a4.png
  /profiles/2024/speaker-456/photo-b2c9e3f1.jpg
```

**Lifecycle Policies:**
- **Active Content**: S3 Standard storage class for content < 1 year old
- **Historical Content**: Transition to S3 Standard-IA after 1 year
- **Archive Content**: Transition to S3 Glacier after 3 years
- **Retention**: Indefinite retention for all event-related content

**Security & Access Control:**
- **Private Buckets**: All buckets private by default, no public access
- **Presigned URLs**: Time-limited presigned URLs for downloads (15-minute expiration)
- **Upload Authentication**: All uploads require valid JWT with appropriate role
- **Server-Side Encryption**: AES-256 encryption at rest (S3-SSE)
- **Versioning**: Enabled for accidental deletion protection

#### CloudFront CDN Configuration

**Distribution Strategy:**
- **Global CDN**: CloudFront distribution per environment for fast worldwide delivery
- **Origin**: S3 buckets as CloudFront origins with Origin Access Identity (OAI)
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching for static content (TTL: 7 days)
- **Custom Domain**: `cdn.batbern.ch`, `cdn-staging.batbern.ch`, `cdn-dev.batbern.ch`

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Edge Locations**: AWS global edge network for low-latency delivery
- **Compression**: Automatic gzip/brotli compression for text-based files
- **HTTP/2**: Enabled for multiplexing and reduced latency
- **Image Optimization**: Lambda@Edge for automatic image resizing and format conversion

**Security Headers:**
- **HTTPS Only**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
- **Security Headers**: CORS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- **Signed URLs**: Optional signed URLs for sensitive content

#### File Size and Format Constraints

**Per Content Type:**

| Content Type | Max Size | Allowed Formats | Validation |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Company Logo | 5 MB | PNG, JPG, SVG | Dimensions: 500x500 to 2000x2000 |
| Speaker Photo | 10 MB | JPG, PNG | Dimensions: min 800x800, aspect ratio 1:1 or 4:3 |
| Speaker CV | 5 MB | PDF | Max 10 pages |
| Presentation | 100 MB | PDF, PPTX | Virus scan required |
| Event Photo | 20 MB | JPG, PNG | Max 4000x4000 |

**Upload Requirements:**
- **Multipart Upload**: Files > 10 MB use multipart upload for reliability
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress for files > 1 MB
- **Virus Scanning**: ClamAV integration for all uploaded files
- **Checksum Verification**: SHA-256 checksum validation on upload completion

#### Storage Quota Policies Per Role

**Role-Based Quotas:**

| Role | Total Storage Quota | Max Files | Max File Size | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Organizer | Unlimited | Unlimited | 100 MB | Full platform administration |
| Speaker | 200 MB | 20 files | 100 MB | Presentation + supporting materials |
| Partner | 50 MB | 5 files | 5 MB | Company logo + marketing materials |
| Attendee | 10 MB | 5 files | 5 MB | Profile photo + bookmarked content |

**Quota Enforcement:**
- **Pre-Upload Check**: Validate available quota before upload
- **Soft Limits**: Warning at 80% quota usage
- **Hard Limits**: Upload rejection at 100% quota
- **Quota Increase**: Manual approval process for speakers exceeding limits

#### Backup and Disaster Recovery

**Backup Strategy:**
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Replicate production bucket to secondary region (eu-west-1 → eu-central-1)
- **Versioning**: S3 versioning enabled for 30-day rollback capability
- **Daily Snapshots**: S3 bucket inventory reports for disaster recovery planning
- **Backup Testing**: Quarterly restore drills to validate backup integrity

**Disaster Recovery:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for full content restoration
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Failover**: Automatic CloudFront failover to secondary region on origin failure
- **Restoration Process**: Documented restoration procedures with runbooks

**Data Integrity:**
- **Checksum Validation**: SHA-256 checksums stored in database for integrity verification
- **Periodic Audits**: Monthly automated integrity checks comparing S3 and database records
- **Orphan Detection**: Identify and cleanup orphaned S3 objects without database references
```
