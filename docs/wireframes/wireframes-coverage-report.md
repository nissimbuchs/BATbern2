## Conclusion

3. **Detailed catering interface** - Can start with basic form
4. **Moderator assignment details** - Can be manual process initially

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed with development** - Current coverage is sufficient for Epic 1-5
2. **Create missing wireframes** during Epic 6-7 timeline
3. **Use third-party tools** temporarily for email and photos
4. **Focus on core platform** functionality first

The platform has comprehensive wireframes for all essential functionality needed to transform BATbern from a static site to a dynamic event management platform.
