5. **Implement PWA capabilities** where relevant for each role

### Navigation Inheritance
Each role-specific wireframe should:
- Import the shared navigation CSS and HTML structure
- Override sidebar content with role-specific navigation
- Maintain header consistency across all roles
- Adapt breadcrumb trails to role context

### Design System Consistency
- Use established color palette for role identification
- Maintain typography hierarchy and spacing
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Ensure responsive design patterns

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Create Organizer Portal Wireframe** - Include all moved workflow automation and AI features
2. **Create Speaker Portal Wireframe** - Focus on submission workflows and communication
3. **Create Partner Portal Wireframe** - Emphasize analytics and strategic input features
4. **Create Attendee Portal Wireframe** - Highlight content discovery and PWA features
5. **Develop component inheritance strategy** - Ensure shared components are reusable across roles

This separation ensures each wireframe focuses on its specific user needs while maintaining a consistent, scalable navigation foundation.
