## Key Architectural Decisions

### Domain-Driven Design Approach
The platform employs a **Domain-Driven Design microservices architecture** with four distinct bounded contexts:
- **Event Management Domain** - Organizer workflows and automation
- **Speaker Coordination Domain** - Speaker portal and workflows
- **Partner Analytics Domain** - ROI tracking and strategic input
- **Attendee Experience Domain** - Content discovery and registration

### Technology Stack Summary
- **Frontend**: React 18.2+ with TypeScript, Material-UI, Zustand + React Query
- **Backend**: Java 21 LTS with Spring Boot 3.2+, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (ECS Fargate, Cognito, S3, CloudFront)
- **Development**: Gradle, Vite, GitHub Actions, AWS CDK

### Repository Structure
The platform uses a **multi-repository approach** for clear ownership and independent deployment:
```
BATbern-Platform/
├── shared-kernel/                 # Shared types, events, utilities
├── event-management-service/      # Organizer workflows & automation
├── speaker-coordination-service/  # Speaker portal & material collection
├── partner-coordination-service/  # Topic voting & meeting coordination
├── attendee-experience-service/   # Content discovery & registration
├── api-gateway/                   # Unified API entry point
├── web-frontend/                  # React frontend consuming all APIs
└── infrastructure/                # Shared infrastructure as code
```
