### Role Playing Technique

**Event Organizer Perspective - Current Workflow Pain Points**:

**Post-Event Planning Process**:
1. **Topic Selection**: Define event topic using backlog of possible topics + avoiding recent duplicates
2. **Speaker Brainstorming**: Identify potential speakers for the topic
3. **Speaker Assignment**: Define who contacts which speaker
4. **Speaker Status Tracking**: Complex status workflow (open → contacted → ready → declined/accepted → final agenda → informed)
5. **Moderation Assignment**: Define event moderator
6. **Content Collection**: Send reminders for materials 1 month before (title, abstract, CV, photo)
7. **Progressive Publishing**: Publish topic immediately, speakers 1 month before with continuous updates
8. **Newsletter Distribution**: Send agenda to mailing list 2 weeks before event
9. **Catering Coordination**: Contact caterer 1 month before for quotes
10. **Venue Management**: Reserve locations 2+ years in advance each January
11. **Partner Meetings**: Spring/autumn sponsor meetings with budgets, statistics, topic brainstorming

**Key Pain Points Identified**:
- Complex speaker status tracking across multiple people
- Manual reminder system for speaker materials
- Coordinating multiple stakeholders (speakers, caterers, venue, partners)
- Progressive content publishing workflow
- Long-term venue and date planning

**Speaker/Presenter Perspective - Decision & Submission Experience**:

**Initial Contact Questions**:
1. **Expertise Match**: "Am I the right person for this topic? Do I have something valuable to say?"
2. **Schedule Compatibility**: "When is the event? Do I have time to attend and prepare?"
3. **Requirements Clarity**: "What information do they want from me?"
4. **Deadlines**: "Submission deadline for abstract? For final slides?"
5. **Submission Process**: "How can I submit requested information online and update if needed?"
6. **Decision Timeline**: "When will I be informed if my presentation is accepted?"
7. **Event Context**: "Target audience size, event scale, location, timing details"
8. **Speaker Portal Access**: "Easy registration to speaker backend, see draft agenda, other speakers, my slot"

**Speaker Pain Points Identified**:
- Lack of upfront event context and expectations
- Unclear submission deadlines and processes
- No self-service portal for information management
- Limited visibility into agenda and other speakers
- Uncertainty about acceptance timeline and criteria

**Partner/Sponsor Perspective - ROI & Strategic Value**:

**Justification Data Needs**:
1. **Employee Engagement Metrics**: Number of company visitors per event, attendance trends over time

3. **Strategic Alignment**: How backlog topics match company's current strategic priorities
4. **Content Performance**: Download statistics for company speakers' presentations on SlideShare
5. **Visual Proof**: Event photos showing company employees and logo visibility
