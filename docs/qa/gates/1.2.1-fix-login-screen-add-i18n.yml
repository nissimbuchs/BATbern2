# Architecture assessment
architecture:
  strengths:
    - "Amplify V6 integration follows official best practices (storage configuration pattern)"
    - "i18n architecture scales elegantly (namespace-based, lazy-loadable)"
    - "Factory pattern for dynamic localized validation schemas"
    - "Centralized error mapping for consistent i18n error handling"
    - "Clean separation of concerns throughout"
    - "Storage abstraction (localStorage vs sessionStorage) properly encapsulated"
    - "API client interceptor pattern clean and testable"

  concerns: []  # All previous concerns resolved

  opportunities:
    - "Code-split translation namespaces when app grows beyond 10 namespaces"
    - "Lazy load validation namespace only on form pages (performance optimization)"
    - "Consider reusable createLocalizedSchema() utility for other forms"
