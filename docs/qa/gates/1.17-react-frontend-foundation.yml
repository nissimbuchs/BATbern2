  reviewer_notes: |
    Excellent work by the dev team. This is a textbook example of how to respond to QA feedback:
    - All 7 critical issues from previous review properly addressed
    - Code quality improved from FAIL (40/100) to PASS (95/100)
    - No shortcuts taken - proper fixes implemented
    - Additional improvements beyond requirements (E2E tests)

    This implementation sets a strong foundation for future domain-specific features (Stories 1.14-1.20).
    Ready for production deployment with confidence.
