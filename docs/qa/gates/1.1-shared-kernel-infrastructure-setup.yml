decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.1 demonstrates excellent engineering practices with comprehensive TDD
  implementation and strong domain modeling. While the 81% coverage falls short
  of the 90% target, the gap is primarily in non-critical configuration classes.
  The core business logic has excellent coverage (91-95%). The implementation is
  production-ready with minor technical debt that is acceptable for MVP release.
