# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.2.2
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.2.2"
story_title: "Implement Forgot Password Flow"
gate: CONDITIONAL_PASS
status_reason: "Implementation is production-ready with excellent security design and comprehensive documentation. QA fixes have resolved all blocking concerns: (1) Backend test coverage now at 100% (15/15 tests), (2) Thread safety improved with CopyOnWriteArrayList, (3) Verification code handling documented with clear decision framework. Story is ready to merge to develop, with post-deployment E2E validation clearly documented."
