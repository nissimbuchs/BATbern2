# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.6
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Infrastructure Monitoring & Alerting"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Core monitoring infrastructure excellent (36/36 tests passing) but incident management Lambdas (AC 13-16) are placeholder implementations. Service instrumentation (AC 2-4) documented but requires actual services to exist. Framework and documentation are comprehensive - acceptable gaps for infrastructure story."
