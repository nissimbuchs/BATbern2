    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Secrets properly referenced through GitHub Secrets. CONCERN: Database passwords passed as CLI args to Flyway (visible in process list) - consider using environment variables or secret files instead."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dependency caching properly configured for both Gradle and npm. Build matrices enable parallel execution. Performance test script created with K6."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Excellent graceful degradation for non-existent services prevents pipeline failures during incremental development. CONCERN: Integration test has generic error suppression ('|| echo warning') that could mask real failures."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured workflows with clear job separation and descriptive naming. Color-coded test output enhances readability. Good use of workflow conditions."

    category: "Test Coverage Validation"
    impact: "Coverage enforcement might not catch real coverage drops"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Implement proper JaCoCo violation rules in Gradle configuration"
      - "Replace Flyway password CLI args with secure environment variable passing"
      - "Validate that error suppression in integration tests doesn't mask failures"
    monitor:
      - "Track when actual microservices are implemented to validate workflow execution"
      - "Complete TODO items in deployment workflows before production use"

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Add JaCoCo violation rules to Gradle configuration"
      refs: ["shared-kernel/build.gradle"]
      details: |
        Replace HTML grep parsing with:
        jacocoTestCoverageVerification {
          violationRules {
            rule {
              limit {
                minimum = 0.90
              }

      details: "Document pipeline architecture, deployment procedures, troubleshooting, and runbooks"

    - action: "Implement 'act' or real workflow testing"
      refs: ["scripts/ci/test-*.sh"]

strengths:
  - "Excellent progressive enhancement approach - workflows gracefully handle missing services"
  - "Comprehensive test script coverage for all 16 acceptance criteria"
  - "Strong workflow structure with clear job dependencies and proper matrix builds"
  - "Semantic versioning implementation with Git tags is well-designed"
  - "Blue-green deployment workflow includes proper health checks and rollback"
  - "Good security practices using GitHub Secrets and AWS credential actions"
  - "Smoke tests are pragmatic with warnings instead of failures for missing services"
  - "Clear separation of concerns across multiple workflow files"

architecture_compliance:
  coding_standards: PASS
  notes: "Follows conventional commit format in Change Log. Bash scripts follow best practices with 'set -e' and proper error handling."

  tech_stack: PASS
  notes: "Uses GitHub Actions, Gradle 8.5+, Node.js 20, JDK 21, AWS services as specified in tech stack."

  testing_strategy: CONCERNS
  notes: "TDD workflow followed (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phases). Test scripts validate pipeline behavior. CONCERN: Tests validate file existence and patterns rather than actual execution."

test_architecture_assessment:
  test_coverage_adequacy: CONCERNS
  test_level_appropriateness: PASS
  test_design_quality: PASS
  test_data_management: PASS
  test_execution: CONCERNS

detailed_findings:
  positive:
    - "All 16 acceptance criteria have corresponding test scripts with clear test naming conventions"
    - "Test scripts follow TDD workflow as documented in coding standards"
    - "Smoke tests balance pragmatism (warnings) with validation (failures for critical issues)"
    - "Build workflow uses fail-fast:false to allow all services to build despite failures"
    - "Version tagging logic correctly handles dev vs production branches"
    - "ECS service stabilization includes proper waiting with configured timeouts"
    - "Database backup precedes migrations in production deployment"
    - "Rollback workflow properly triggers on failure() condition"

  areas_for_improvement:
    - "Test scripts validate configuration rather than behavior - consider contract testing"
    - "Coverage enforcement parsing is brittle (relies on HTML grep) - use native Gradle checks"
    - "Some error suppressions may hide real failures during incremental development"
    - "Frontend coverage check uses '|| true' which always passes - should enforce threshold"
    - "Codecov token might not be configured (will fail silently)"
    - "Performance tests created but not integrated into workflow"
    - "SonarQube integration present but quality gate wait might timeout if not configured"
    - "No validation that Docker images actually contain working applications"

testability_evaluation:
  controllability: PASS
  notes: "Workflows can be triggered manually. Build parameters are configurable. Environment-specific configurations supported."

  observability: PASS
  notes: "Comprehensive logging with color-coded output. Artifact uploads for test reports. CloudWatch integration planned."

  debuggability: CONCERNS
  notes: "Good error messages in test scripts. CONCERN: Some failures suppressed with warnings make debugging harder. No debug mode toggle."
