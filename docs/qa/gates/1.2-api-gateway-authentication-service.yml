    details: |
      The no-arg constructor in DefaultCognitoJWKSProvider allows Algorithm.none() to be returned
      in production if instantiated without jwksUrl. CognitoJWTValidator has a bypass that skips
      proper JWT verification when algorithm is "none". This creates a critical security vulnerability
      allowing attackers to forge tokens with no signature.

      CRITICAL FLAW: Algorithm.none() bypass allows complete JWT signature verification bypass.
      Otherwise well implemented: JWT validation, RBAC, rate limiting, CORS, security headers, audit logging.

    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code structure reasonable but <50ms P95 not verified without load testing.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
