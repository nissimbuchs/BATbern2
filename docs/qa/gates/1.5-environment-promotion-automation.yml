nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      + Proper secret management via GitHub Secrets
      + OIDC authentication with AWS (no static credentials)
      + JIRA ticket verification for production deployments
      + Environment-specific IAM roles with least privilege
      + Audit logging implemented
      - Security scan uses basic npm audit (consider Snyk/Trivy for production)
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      + Performance thresholds defined (500ms P95 latency)
      + Canary monitoring with configurable success rate (99%)
      + ECS service stabilization checks
      + 5-minute canary observation window
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      + One-click rollback capability
      + Blue-green deployment strategy
      + Health check validation
      + Multi-stage validation gates
      + 2-hour stability requirement before promotion
      + Database backward compatibility checks
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      + Excellent test coverage (32/32 tests)
      + Clear script documentation and usage
      + Comprehensive error messages
      - GNU-specific date commands limit portability
      - Some scripts could benefit from more modular functions

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Replace GNU date -d with portable alternative'
      refs:
        - '.github/workflows/promote-to-staging.yml:50'
        - '.github/workflows/promote-to-production.yml:66'
      rationale: 'GitHub Actions runners are Linux (GNU date works), but local testing on macOS will fail'
      suggestion: 'Use: date -u +%s for current time, or python/node for date parsing'
    - action: 'Add --force flag to rollback script to skip 10-second wait'
      refs:
        - 'scripts/ci/rollback-deployment.sh:33'
      rationale: 'In emergency situations, 10-second delay could be critical'
      suggestion: 'if [ "$2" != "--force" ]; then sleep 10; fi'
  future:
    - action: 'Parameterize environment in monitor-canary.sh'
      refs:
        - 'scripts/ci/monitor-canary.sh:19'
      rationale: 'Enable canary testing in staging environment'
    - action: 'Consider structured logging (JSON) for better observability'
      refs:
        - 'scripts/ci/*.sh'
      rationale: 'Enable better log aggregation and alerting'
    - action: 'Add workflow syntax validation in pre-commit hooks'
      refs:
        - '.github/workflows/*.yml'
      rationale: 'Catch YAML syntax errors before commit'
      suggestion: 'Use actionlint in pre-commit hooks'
    - action: 'Add integration test for full promotion flow'
      refs:
        - 'e2e-tests/'
      rationale: 'Current tests validate configuration, not runtime behavior'
      suggestion: 'Create test environment and validate actual promotion'

test_architecture_assessment:
  coverage_level: excellent
  test_quality: high
  test_maintainability: high
  notes: |
    Exemplary TDD implementation:
    + All 16 ACs have 2 tests each (positive + negative)
    + Tests follow should_expectedBehavior_when_condition naming
    + Clear test organization by AC grouping
    + Tests validate both configuration and error handling
    + Comprehensive output with colored pass/fail indicators

    Test improvements for consideration:
    - Add runtime integration tests (current tests are static validation)
    - Consider parameterized tests for different environment combinations
    - Add chaos engineering tests (network failures, AWS API errors)
