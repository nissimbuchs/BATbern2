nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No secrets in code, hooks bypassable only with explicit flag, sandboxed npm execution"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pre-commit <10s, pre-push 1-3min, timeout protection, processes only changed files"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Good error handling but no automated validation of hook execution. Manual testing confirmed working."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented, clear structure, now uses commitlint for better maintainability. Color-coded output enhances UX."

code_quality:
  strengths:
    - "Clean, well-structured hook scripts with consistent patterns"
    - "Excellent documentation (workflow guide + troubleshooting)"
    - "Good error handling with helpful, color-coded messages"
    - "Proper separation of concerns (fast pre-commit vs comprehensive pre-push)"
    - "Timeout protection prevents hung builds"

  issues_fixed:
    - "Missing commit-msg hook installation causing silent validation failure"
    - "Monorepo path handling causing file not found errors"
    - "Duplicate validation logic instead of leveraging commitlint"
    - "No installation verification output"

  technical_debt:
    - "No automated tests for infrastructure code (acceptable for simplified scope)"
    - "integrationTest Gradle task not verified to exist"
    - "Checkstyle configuration pending (when Java services implemented)"

testing_assessment:
  approach: "Manual testing only - acceptable for simplified infrastructure story"
  coverage: "N/A - bash scripts, not part of application test suite"
  gaps:
    - "No automated validation of hook execution"
    - "No CI smoke tests for hook installation"
  recommendation: "Add basic shell script tests in Story B1 for production readiness"

    note: "Initial review found 3 critical bugs. All fixed by QA. Remaining concerns are technical debt (no automated tests) and minor verification needed (integrationTest task)."
