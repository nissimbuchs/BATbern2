## Story B1: Advanced Quality Infrastructure & TDD Automation

**Original Story**: 1.8 from Epic 1

**User Story:**
As a **tech lead**, I want automated quality gates and TDD enforcement in our development workflow, so that we maintain high code quality and prevent technical debt accumulation.

**Why Deferred:**
- Epic 1 Story 1.4 (CI/CD) already provides basic quality gates
- Epic 1 Story 1.7 (Basic Developer Workflow) provides git hooks and linting
- GitHub's built-in code scanning (Dependabot, CodeQL) covers security
- SonarQube, mutation testing valuable but not blocking MVP delivery

**Current Alternative:**
- Use GitHub code scanning and basic coverage from CI/CD pipeline
- Simple git hooks for linting and test execution
- Manual code review for quality

**Implementation Triggers:**
- Codebase exceeds 50,000 lines of code
- Team size grows beyond 5 developers
- Technical debt metrics show concerning trends
- Regulatory compliance requires advanced quality tracking

**Acceptance Criteria (When Implemented):**

**Advanced Quality Tools:**
1. **SonarQube Deployment**: Self-hosted or SonarCloud integration
2. **Quality Profiles**: Custom rules for Java and TypeScript
3. **Quality Gates**: Coverage >90%, complexity <15, duplication <3%
4. **Security Scanning**: Advanced SAST/DAST beyond GitHub tools

**Mutation Testing:**
5. **PITest (Java)**: Mutation testing for backend services
6. **Stryker (TypeScript)**: Mutation testing for frontend
7. **Mutation Score**: >80% mutation score required

## Story B2: Circuit Breaker & Resilience Infrastructure

**Original Story**: 1.10 from Epic 1

**User Story:**
As a **backend developer**, I want resilience patterns implemented for all external service dependencies, so that our system gracefully handles failures and maintains availability.

**Why Deferred:**
- AWS managed services (Cognito, S3, SES, RDS) have 99.9%+ uptime SLAs
- Resilience4j circuit breakers are overkill for highly reliable dependencies
- Basic error handling from Story 1.9 provides foundation
- No complex microservice choreography requiring advanced patterns

**Current Alternative:**
- Basic try-catch error handling with proper logging
- Simple retry logic for critical paths (3 retries with exponential backoff)
- Timeouts configured for all external calls

**Implementation Triggers:**
- Production experiences repeated service failures
- Integration with unreliable third-party APIs
- Complex microservice orchestration requiring fault isolation
- Cascading failures observed in production

**Acceptance Criteria (When Implemented):**

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
1. **Resilience4j Integration**: Add to all microservices
2. **Service Circuit Breakers**: Configure for each external dependency
3. **Failure Thresholds**: Define failure rates and timeouts per service
4. **Half-Open State**: Implement recovery detection

**Retry & Fallback:**
5. **Retry Policies**: Service-specific retry configurations
6. **Exponential Backoff**: With jitter to prevent thundering herd
7. **Fallback Strategies**: Cache fallbacks, default responses, graceful degradation
8. **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle permanent failures

**Observability:**

## Story B3: Performance SLA & Advanced Monitoring

**Original Story**: 1.12 from Epic 1

**User Story:**
As a **platform engineer**, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and SLA tracking, so that we can ensure our platform meets performance commitments and user expectations.

**Why Deferred:**
- Epic 1 Story 1.6 (Infrastructure Monitoring) provides CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
- No formal SLA commitments to customers yet
- Performance baselines unknown without production traffic
- Dedicated tools premature before understanding actual performance characteristics

**Current Alternative:**
- CloudWatch metrics for all services from Story 1.6
- Basic performance checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual performance testing when needed

**Implementation Triggers:**
- Formal SLA commitments made to customers/partners
- Production traffic reaches significant volume (>1000 req/min)
- Performance degradation patterns observed
- Business requirements for performance guarantees

**Acceptance Criteria (When Implemented):**

**Performance Baselines:**
1. **API Performance**: Track P50, P95, P99 latencies per endpoint
2. **Database Performance**: Query execution time analysis
3. **Frontend Performance**: Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
4. **End-to-End Performance**: User journey timing analysis

**SLA Tracking:**
5. **Availability SLA**: 99.9% uptime tracking with automated reporting
6. **Performance SLA**: Response time commitments per service
7. **Error Rate SLA**: Maximum error thresholds (<0.1%)
8. **SLA Dashboards**: Real-time compliance visibility

9. **Load Testing**: JMeter/K6 integration in CI/CD
10. **Stress Testing**: Breaking point identification
11. **Performance Regression**: Automated regression detection
12. **Capacity Planning**: Predictive scaling models

**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks

## Story B4: Advanced Caching Strategy

**Original Story**: 1.13 from Epic 1

**User Story:**
As a **backend developer**, I want a comprehensive caching strategy implemented across all services, so that we achieve optimal performance and reduce database load.

**Why Deferred:**
- Redis infrastructure already in place from Epic 1 Story 1.3
- Simple cache-aside pattern with sensible TTLs sufficient for MVP
- Advanced patterns require traffic data to optimize
- Premature optimization without performance profiling data

**Current Alternative:**
- Simple cache-aside pattern for hot data
- Sensible TTLs (5-15 min for events, 1 hour for speakers)
- Manual cache invalidation when needed

**Implementation Triggers:**
- Performance profiling identifies caching as bottleneck
- Database load becomes concerning (>70% utilization)
- Specific hot paths need optimization (proven by data)
- Cache hit rate consistently <70%

**Acceptance Criteria (When Implemented):**

**Advanced Caching Patterns:**
1. **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Already implemented (validate effectiveness)
2. **Write-Through Cache**: Synchronous cache updates for critical data
3. **Write-Behind Cache**: Asynchronous batch updates for performance
4. **Cache Warming**: Preload critical data on startup

**Cache Optimization:**
5. **Hit Rate Optimization**: Target >90% cache hit rate for hot paths
6. **TTL Strategies**: Data-driven TTLs based on update frequency

14. **Cache Latency**: <5ms P95 for cache operations
15. **Memory Efficiency**: <2GB per service instance
16. **Invalidation Speed**: <100ms for critical data updates

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

## Decision Framework: When to Activate This Epic

**Activate When ANY of:**
- âœ… Codebase exceeds 50,000 lines of code
- âœ… Team size exceeds 5 developers
- âœ… Production traffic exceeds 1,000 requests/minute
- âœ… Formal SLA commitments made to customers
- âœ… Performance issues observed in production
- âœ… Service reliability drops below 99.9%
- âœ… Technical debt score exceeds acceptable threshold

**Validate Decision By:**
- Running performance profiling to identify real bottlenecks
- Analyzing production incident reports for patterns
- Measuring actual cache hit rates and database load
- Reviewing code quality metrics and test coverage trends
- Assessing team feedback on development pain points

## Philosophy

**Progressive Infrastructure**: Build advanced infrastructure patterns **when proven necessary** by operational data, not preemptively. This backlog epic represents valuable enhancements that become essential as the platform scales, but implementing them prematurely would delay functional delivery without corresponding value.

**Data-Driven Decisions**: Each story in this epic should be activated based on **metrics and evidence**, not assumptions. Let production usage guide infrastructure investment priorities.
