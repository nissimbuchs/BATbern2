- **Outcome**: Start Epic 2 **4 months earlier**, first stakeholder demo in Q2 instead of Q4

**üí° Value Proposition:**
This revised Epic 1 delivers the **essential foundation** needed for functional development while deferring **infrastructure gold plating** to a backlog epic. The platform launches with:
- ‚úÖ Solid authentication, monitoring, and deployment capabilities
- ‚úÖ Essential security and error handling
- ‚úÖ All core microservices and frontend ready for feature development
- üì¶ Advanced infrastructure patterns available when proven necessary by real usage

**Philosophy**: Build infrastructure **progressively** alongside business features, not all upfront. This approach accelerates time-to-value while maintaining quality and allowing infrastructure to mature based on actual operational needs rather than theoretical requirements.
