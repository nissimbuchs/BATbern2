- **Why**: AWS managed services (Cognito, S3, SES, RDS) have 99.9%+ uptime SLAs. Advanced resilience patterns (Resilience4j circuit breakers, sophisticated retry logic) are valuable but overkill for MVP with highly reliable dependencies.
- **Alternative**: Basic try-catch error handling from Story 1.9, simple retry logic for critical paths (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff for email sending)
- **When to Implement**: When you experience real production failures, have complex microservice choreography, or need to call unreliable third-party APIs
- **Time Saved**: 2-3 weeks redirected to functional features

**Architecture Integration:**
- **Resilience Library**: Resilience4j for Java services
- **Circuit Breakers**: Configured for AWS services (SES, S3, Cognito)
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation patterns

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
1. **Service Circuit Breakers**: Configure for each external dependency
2. **Failure Thresholds**: Define failure rates and timeouts
3. **Half-Open State**: Implement recovery detection
4. **Metrics Collection**: Track circuit breaker state changes

**Retry Mechanisms:**
5. **Retry Policies**: Service-specific retry configurations
6. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement with jitter to prevent thundering herd

- [ ] GDPR data export endpoint implemented and tested
- [ ] GDPR deletion endpoint implemented with cascade logic tested
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations (user data access, modifications)
- [ ] GitHub Dependabot and CodeQL enabled and verified
- [ ] Basic security checklist documented

**REMOVED FROM SCOPE (Moved to Backlog):**
- ❌ Advanced SAST/DAST tools (Snyk, SonarQube security) (AC13 original)
- ❌ Comprehensive penetration testing (AC16 original)
- ❌ Advanced consent management system (AC9 original)
- ❌ Detailed compliance reports and certifications (AC16 original)
- ❌ Security training program (AC16 original)

**Rationale for Simplification:**
Essential security controls (headers, input validation, basic GDPR) provide the foundation needed for launch. Advanced security scanning and compliance reporting can be added as the platform matures and regulatory requirements become more specific.

**Effort Reduction:** 3 weeks → **1.5 weeks**

## Story 1.12: Performance Monitoring & SLA Infrastructure (📦 MOVED TO BACKLOG)

**Status:** 📦 **BACKLOG** - Deferred to "Infrastructure Enhancements" Epic

**User Story:**
As a **platform engineer**, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and SLA tracking, so that we can ensure our platform meets performance commitments and user expectations.

**⚠️ DECISION: MOVED TO BACKLOG**
- **Why**: Story 1.6 (Infrastructure Monitoring) already provides CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and basic performance tracking. Dedicated SLA tracking, JMeter/K6 performance testing suites, and capacity planning models are valuable but premature before launch.
- **Alternative**: Use existing CloudWatch metrics from Story 1.6, basic performance checks in CI/CD

**User Story:**
As a **backend developer**, I want a comprehensive caching strategy implemented across all services, so that we achieve optimal performance and reduce database load.

**⚠️ DECISION: MOVED TO BACKLOG**
- **Why**: Caffeine in-memory caching is implemented at the application level (Story 1.3). Advanced distributed caching patterns (write-behind, cache warming, sophisticated invalidation, >90% hit rate optimization) are premature optimization before having real traffic patterns and performance data.
- **Alternative**: Simple Caffeine cache-aside pattern with sensible TTLs (e.g., 5-15 min for events, 1 hour for speaker profiles)
- **When to Implement**: When performance profiling identifies caching as a bottleneck, or when distributed caching is needed for horizontal scaling
- **Time Saved**: 2-3 weeks redirected to functional features

**Architecture Integration:**
- **Cache Layer**: Caffeine in-memory caching with optional distributed cache later
- **Cache Patterns**: Cache-aside, write-through, write-behind
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-driven invalidation strategies
- **Cache Monitoring**: Hit rates and performance tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Caffeine Infrastructure:**
1. **Cache Configurations**: Service-specific cache configurations
2. **Eviction Policies**: Size-based and time-based eviction
3. **Monitoring**: Cache statistics and metrics
4. **Testing**: Cache behavior verification

**Caching Patterns:**
5. **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Lazy loading for read-heavy data
6. **Write-Through Cache**: Synchronous cache updates
7. **Write-Behind Cache**: Asynchronous batch updates
8. **Cache Warming**: Preload critical data on startup

**Cache Management:**
9. **TTL Strategies**: Appropriate TTLs per data type
10. **Cache Invalidation**: Event-based invalidation
11. **Cache Versioning**: Handle schema changes
12. **Memory Management**: Eviction policies configuration

**Performance Optimization:**
13. **Hit Rate Optimization**: Target >90% cache hit rate
14. **Serialization**: Efficient serialization formats
15. **Memory Efficiency**: Optimize cache sizing per service
16. **Performance Testing**: Validate cache effectiveness

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Caffeine caching operational in all services
