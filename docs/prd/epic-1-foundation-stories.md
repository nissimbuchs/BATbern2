2. **Input Validation**: Spring @Valid annotations for all @RequestBody with constraint violations returning 400
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: JPA/Hibernate parameterized queries (already enforced by ORM)
4. **XSS Protection**: Output encoding via Thymeleaf (if server-side rendering) or React's built-in escaping

**Authentication & Authorization (Leveraging Existing):**
5. **JWT Validation**: Already in API Gateway (Story 1.2) - verify integration
6. **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting at API Gateway level (requests per minute per user)
7. **Password Policies**: AWS Cognito password requirements (min 8 chars, complexity rules)

**GDPR Compliance Basics:**
8. **Data Export**: REST API endpoint to export user's personal data as JSON
9. **Right to Deletion**: REST API endpoint to delete user data (cascade through services)
10. **Audit Logging**: Log all data access and modifications to CloudWatch with user ID

**Security Scanning Basics:**
11. **Dependency Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot enabled for vulnerable dependency alerts
12. **SAST Scanning**: GitHub CodeQL enabled for basic static analysis

- [ ] JWT validation tested in integration tests (API Gateway → Service flow)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured and tested (verify 429 responses at threshold)
- [ ] GDPR data export endpoint implemented and tested
- [ ] GDPR deletion endpoint implemented with cascade logic tested
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations (user data access, modifications)
- [ ] GitHub Dependabot and CodeQL enabled and verified
- [ ] Basic security checklist documented

**REMOVED FROM SCOPE (Moved to Backlog):**
- ❌ Advanced SAST/DAST tools (Snyk, SonarQube security) (AC13 original)
- ❌ Comprehensive penetration testing (AC16 original)
- ❌ Advanced consent management system (AC9 original)
- ❌ Detailed compliance reports and certifications (AC16 original)
- ❌ Security training program (AC16 original)

**Rationale for Simplification:**
Essential security controls (headers, input validation, basic GDPR) provide the foundation needed for launch. Advanced security scanning and compliance reporting can be added as the platform matures and regulatory requirements become more specific.

**Effort Reduction:** 3 weeks → **1.5 weeks**

## Story 1.12: Performance Monitoring & SLA Infrastructure (📦 MOVED TO BACKLOG)

**Status:** 📦 **BACKLOG** - Deferred to "Infrastructure Enhancements" Epic

**User Story:**
As a **platform engineer**, I want comprehensive performance monitoring and SLA tracking, so that we can ensure our platform meets performance commitments and user expectations.

**⚠️ DECISION: MOVED TO BACKLOG**
- **Why**: Story 1.6 (Infrastructure Monitoring) already provides CloudWatch metrics, dashboards, and basic performance tracking. Dedicated SLA tracking, JMeter/K6 performance testing suites, and capacity planning models are valuable but premature before launch.
- **Alternative**: Use existing CloudWatch metrics from Story 1.6, basic performance checks in CI/CD
- **When to Implement**: After initial launch when you have real user traffic, SLA commitments to customers, and baseline performance data to optimize against
- **Time Saved**: 2 weeks redirected to functional features

**Architecture Integration:**
- **Metrics Collection**: Micrometer with CloudWatch backend
- **APM Tools**: AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing

## Story 1.13: Advanced Caching Strategy Implementation (📦 MOVED TO BACKLOG)

**Status:** 📦 **BACKLOG** - Deferred to "Infrastructure Enhancements" Epic

**User Story:**
As a **backend developer**, I want a comprehensive caching strategy implemented across all services, so that we achieve optimal performance and reduce database load.

**⚠️ DECISION: MOVED TO BACKLOG**
- **Why**: Redis infrastructure is already in place from Story 1.3. Advanced caching patterns (write-behind, cache warming, sophisticated invalidation, >90% hit rate optimization) are premature optimization before having real traffic patterns and performance data.
- **Alternative**: Simple cache-aside pattern with sensible TTLs (e.g., 5-15 min for events, 1 hour for speaker profiles)
- **When to Implement**: When performance profiling identifies caching as a bottleneck, or when you have data showing specific hot paths needing optimization
- **Time Saved**: 2-3 weeks redirected to functional features

**Architecture Integration:**
- **Cache Layer**: Redis with cluster configuration
- **Cache Patterns**: Cache-aside, write-through, write-behind
- **Cache Invalidation**: Event-driven invalidation strategies
- **Cache Monitoring**: Hit rates and performance tracking

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Redis Infrastructure:**
1. **Redis Clusters**: Environment-specific cluster configurations
2. **Persistence Strategy**: RDB + AOF for data durability
3. **Replication**: Master-slave replication setup
4. **Failover**: Automatic failover with Redis Sentinel

**Caching Patterns:**
5. **Cache-Aside Pattern**: Lazy loading for read-heavy data
6. **Write-Through Cache**: Synchronous cache updates
7. **Write-Behind Cache**: Asynchronous batch updates
8. **Cache Warming**: Preload critical data on startup

**Cache Management:**
9. **TTL Strategies**: Appropriate TTLs per data type
10. **Cache Invalidation**: Event-based invalidation
11. **Cache Versioning**: Handle schema changes
12. **Memory Management**: Eviction policies configuration

**Performance Optimization:**
13. **Hit Rate Optimization**: Target >90% cache hit rate
14. **Serialization**: Efficient serialization formats
15. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize Redis connections
16. **Pipeline Operations**: Batch Redis operations

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] Redis clusters operational in all environments
- [ ] Cache patterns implemented consistently
- [ ] Cache hit rate >90% for hot paths
- [ ] Invalidation strategies tested and working
- [ ] Cache monitoring dashboards created
- [ ] Performance improvements measured and documented
- [ ] Cache sizing optimized for cost
- [ ] Team trained on caching patterns
